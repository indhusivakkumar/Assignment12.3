1)Explain the uses of NoSQL Databases in brief and list the current NoSQL databases
which are available.

Uses of NoSQL Database:
 * Highly scalable
 * It answers to the limitations of relational databases in handling Big Data requirements.
 * It offers greater data model flexibility, horizontal scalability, and superior performance over relational databases.
 * It handles large volumes of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
 * Low latency and high performance
 * It follows modern development practices such as agile sprints, quick iterations, and frequent code pushes.
 * It prefers object-oriented programming which is easy to use and flexible.
 * It provides efficient, scale-out architecture instead of expensive, monolithic architecture.
 * It provides Non-relational and schema-less data model.

Current NoSQL databases:

Document databases
Graph stores 
Key-value stores
Wide-column stores

*Document databases -It pairs each key with a complex data structure known as a document. 
*Graph stores - used to store information about networks of data like social connections. It includes Neo4J and Giraph.
*Key-value stores - simplest NoSQL databases. Every single item in the database is stored as a key along with its value. Examples  are Riak and Berkeley DB. 
*Wide-column stores like Cassandra and HBase are optimized for queries over large datasets, and store columns of data together, instead of rows.

2)Explain the Differences between Hive and HBase in Brief with examples.

Differences between Hive and HBase:

 * Hive is an SQL-like engine which runs MapReduce jobs while HBase is a NoSQL key/value database on Hadoop.
 * Hive can be used for analytical queries while HBase for real-time querying
 * Hive allows for querying data stored on HDFS for analysis via HQL, an SQL-like language that gets translated to MapReduce jobs while Apache HBase is a NoSQL
   key/value store which runs on top of HDFS.
 * Hive does not provide interactive querying, it only runs batch processes on Hadoop while  HBase is defined as a cell, and each key consists of row-key, 
   column family, column, and time-stamp.
 * Hive’s partitioning feature allows running a filter query over data that is stored in separate folders, and only read the data which matches the query while HBase
   Versioning is available so that previous values of the data can be fetched.
 * Hive is a front end for parsing SQL statements, generating logical plans, optimizing logical plans, translating them into physical plans that are executed by 
   MapReduce jobs and HBase is a real time, open source, column oriented, distributed NoSql database written in Java.
 * Apache Hive is designed for  data warehouse system to ease the processing of adhoc queries on massive data sets stored in HDFS and  data aggregations while 
   HBase is designed after Google’s BigTable and represents a key value column family store. It is built on top of Apache Hadoop.


Examples:
 
Hive should be used for analytical querying of data collected over a period of time for example calculating trends or website logs.
HBase is perfect for real-time querying of Big Data for example Facebook use it for messaging and real-time analytics. 
They may even be using it to count Facebook likes.
